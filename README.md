#Clone hard drivers *on the fly*, for back up purposes

It means that when you create, edit, delete or move a file inside a hard driver, the application will automatically apply any change to a back up path, for example a external hard drive, or some network path.

This VB.NET application keeps listening a directory for changes. When some change is detected, the same change will be applied to the back up directory.
