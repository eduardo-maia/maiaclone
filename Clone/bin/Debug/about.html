Maia Clone v.1.0

The easyiest and fastest software to backup high amount of data.

Free for both personal and commercial use.


Why use this software

Because disk failures always happens, and you need to backup easy and fast all your movies, musics, and work files. I just plugged an USB hard drive to my desktop, and then use this program often to backup all my important files. You can also copy to another directory, like a network drive.

Tired of testing non-working backup software, I decided to make my own. And I finally got a software that meet everybody needs.


Why not use this software

This software allows to restore your important files in any computer. But it is not designed to make a ghost drive, I mean, if you want an exact mirror of all your hard drive (including internal Windows files) to boot in another machine.


Features

-> Supports multibytes characteres (russian, japanese, chinese, etc). Pretty hard to find a software like this.

-> Fast. Copy to backup path only new or modified files. Saves time.

-> Remove from your backup path files that you deleted from source directory. Better than GNU rsync.

-> Easy to use. Just inform your source diretory (where files need to be backed up) and destination directory (where files will be copied to, for example your external USB hard disk)


Warning

This software deletes files that doesn't exist in your source directory, so do not configure your backup directory to a directory with other files.

I suggest you to first run this software with an empty directory as destination directory, and then run again each time you need to syncronize your files.
